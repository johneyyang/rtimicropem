#' ammon allows you to read and analyse data from MicroPEM output files
#' in a reproducible way. MicroPEM are devices developped by RTI \url{http://www.rti.org/page.cfm/Aerosol_Sensors}.
#' It is called ammon like Zeus Ammon (\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amun#Greece})
#' because it helps us to Analyse Micropem MONitoring data
#' and it should be cool like a god. That being said, please don't worship it
#' and help us look for bugs in the code.
