\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{settings}}{Data.frame (\code{dplyr "tbl_df"}) with settings of the micropem device and other information such as download time.}

\item{\code{calibration}}{List of calibration information.}

\item{\code{filename}}{Filename from which the oject was built.}

\item{\code{measures}}{Data.frame (\code{dplyr "tbl_df"}) with all time-varying measures, possibly:
\describe{
  \item{datetime}{Time and date of each measurement, as a POSIXt object. Depending on the different logs of the time-varying variables there is not a measure for all variables associated to each timepoint.}
  \item{rh_corrected_nephelometer}{Measures of nephelometer in microgram/meter cube (numeric).}
  \item{temp}{Measures of temperature in centigrade (numeric).}
  \item{rh}{Measures of relative humidity that are a proportion and as such do not have an unit (numeric).}
  \item{battery}{Measures of battery  UNIT PLEASE (numeric).}
  \item{orifice_press}{Measures of orifice pressure in inches of water (numeric).}
  \item{inlet_press}{Measures of inlet pressure in inches of water (numeric).}
  \item{flow}{Measures of flow in liters per minute (numeric).}
  \item{x_axis}{x-axis accelerometer UNIT PLEASE (numeric).}
  \item{y_axis}{y-axis accelerometer UNIT PLEASE (numeric).}
  \item{z_axis}{z-axis accelerometer UNIT PLEASE (numeric).}
  \item{vector_sum_composite}{vector sum UNIT PLEASE (numeric).}
  \item{message}{Shutdown reason (factor).}
  }}

\item{\code{original}}{Boolean. Is this an original micropem object (TRUE) or was it e.g. filtered or cleaned (FALSE).}
}}
\section{Methods}{

\describe{
  \item{plot}{Method for getting a quick plot of all time-varying measurements.
  Either \code{type ="plain"} or \code{type ="interactive"}, see examples.
  The method returns a plot of the \code{ggplot}-class. One can add a title via the \code{title} argument.}
  \item{summary}{Method for getting a summary table (\code{dplyr "tbl_df"}) of all time-varying numeric measurements.}
  \item{print}{Method for printing both the summary table of all time-varying numeric measurements and all settings from the \code{settings} field.}
  }
